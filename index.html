      <p>I enjoy bringing order to both tech and code. I have experience in system administration and can quickly spot and fix any technical issue. <br>
Recently, I’ve been diving into front-end development — building responsive websites with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, making sure everything looks modern and runs smoothly. <br>
I also have hands-on experience with networks, hardware setup, and technical support, which helps me connect the “hardware” side with a clean and user-friendly interface.</p>
